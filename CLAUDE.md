# Project Overview

- This will be a Pokedex application that will display all pokemons
- Use PokeAPI: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon` to fetch all pokemons
- Use PokeAPI: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{name}` or `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{id}` to fetch the details of a pokemon
- Use the `provider` package
- Use the `dio` package for requests
- Use the `infinite_scroll_pagination` for infinite scrolling
- Follow the feature-first architecture when developing the application
- If you're stuck or unsure, stop to ask me first

## Home Page
- Paginated list of all Pokemons using with infinite scrolling. Each page should contain 20 items
- Search bar that will search for the user's input. Make it a hybrid search, client-side search firstâ€“then if the Pokemon being searched for hasn't been loaded yet search via API

# Details Page
- Display the relevant details about the Pokemon
- Make it pleasing to the eyes by using things like bars, etc. (when applicable) for displaying information
